1. With Saucelabs
2. With AWS Devicefarm
3. With Dockers
On local machine, create docker images of 
a. appium
b. selenium hub
c. android emulator node

Below is the command line execution
------------------------------------
mvn verify -Dappium.hub=http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub -Dwebdriver.driver=appium
Now mvn verify will work
To commit from command prompt,

Concepts
--------
1. Background keyword are used in Gherkin to describe the pre-condition
Example of feature files
-------------------------
Feature: Logging on to the 'My Flying High' website
	Frequent Flyer members can register on the 'My Flying High' website
	using their Frequent Flyer number and a password that they provide
	
	Background: Martin is registered on the site
		Given Martin is a Frequent Flyer member
		And Martin has registered online with a password of 'secret'
		
	Scenario: Logging on successfully
		When Martin logs on with password 'secret'
		Then he should be given access to the site
		
	Scenario: Logging on with an incorrect password
		When Martin logs on with password 'wrong'
		Then he should be informed that his password was incorrect
		
	Scenario: Logging on with an expired account
		Given the account has expired
		When Martin logs on with password 'secret'
		Then he should be informed that his account has expired
		And he should be invited to renew his account
		
2. Tags - This can be used to run the before test method for the scenarios where it expected
Feature: Joining the Frequent Flyer Program
@end-to-end
Scenario: Registering online for a new Frequent Flyer account
